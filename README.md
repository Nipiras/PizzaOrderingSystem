# Pizza Ordering System [OOP]
Hands-on project of Object Oriented Programming exercise on Python

# Overview
The project aims for users to design their own pizza and add the user's information to the database after payment.

- The Pizza Ordering System starts with the users choosing the pizza on the menu and the ingredients they want. 
After selecting the ingredient and pizza, user information must be entered for payment.

   ### The Project Task
      Importing Required Libraries

      Using the menu in the "menu.txt" file

      Create superclass “Pizza”
      - Define the Pizza class and the `get_description()` and `get_cost()` methods for encapsulation within that class.
          - This description should be a short description of the pizza being prepared!

      Create pizza subclasses
      - Create subclasses for pizzas on the menu.
          - Each pizza should have its own price and description.

      Create class “Decorator”
      - This class should be the super class of ingredient classes.
      - This class will use the `get_description()` and `get_cost()` methods using the properties of the Pizza class. 
      Complete the decorator class using the following methods.

           ---
          def get_cost(self):
           return self.component.get_cost() + Pizza.get_cost(self)

          def get_description(self):
           return self.component.get_description() + ' ' + Pizza.get_description(self)
           ---

      - Create subclasses for ingredients on the menu.
           - Each ingredient should have its own price and description.
           
      Create a main function. 
      - This function will print the menu first. It will then allow the user to select a pizza and toppings from the menu. 
      After calculating the total price of the selected products, the user should receive:
      the name, surname, TR ID number, credit card number and credit card password information.
      - The collected data and the user's order time should be recorded here in the "Orders_Database.csv" file.
